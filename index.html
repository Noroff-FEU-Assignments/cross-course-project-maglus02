    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">If I where to advise a potential client about securing their website I would firstly let the client know about the most common web security threats. Security threats like: SQL injection, Cross-Site request forgery and Cross-Site scripting. After I would also go through some other common vulnerabilities, like Clickjacking and Denial of Serivce, etc. Then I would give the client advise on how they can protect themselves against those. After that I would go over some good practices when it comes to web security. Some practices i would go over include: data encryption, going through known vulnerabilities when coding, data sanitization, regularly scanning your application for threats and vulnerabilities, effective password management, using HTTPS, and keeping software updated. Lastly I would introduce them to tools they could use to check for vulnerabilities in their application, like a website vulnerability scanner. Tools like those are nice to have when working on your application.</p>
